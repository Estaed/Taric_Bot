## Project Rules

These replace old `.cursorrules`. Whenever you start a user command with **"okay super"**, Cursor will:

1. Open `[prd.md](mdc:prd.md)`.
2. Find the **## Done** section.
3. Grab the summary of your most recently approved feature.
4. If it's not already listed, append it to **## Done**.

*(Fires only on prompts beginning with "okay super.")*
