# Model Evaluation and Deployment

## Evaluation Metrics
The evaluation suite in [src/train_rl.py](mdc:src/train_rl.py) tracks:
- Win rate against different champions
- Average KDA
- Objective control rate
- Team fight participation

## Model Deployment
The inference system is implemented in [src/infer.py](mdc:src/infer.py) and includes:

### Action Selection
- Mouse movement prediction
- Click type selection
- Ability timing
- Target selection

### Safety Checks
- Maximum click rate limits
- Ability cooldown checks
- Target validation

### Visualization
- Mouse movement paths
- Ability usage timing
- Target selection reasoning

## CLI Interface
The command line interface in [src/cli.py](mdc:src/cli.py) provides:
- Model loading and inference
- Performance monitoring
- Automated retraining
- Logging and metrics collection
