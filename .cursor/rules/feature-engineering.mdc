# Feature Engineering Guide

Feature engineering scripts are located in [src/features/](mdc:src/features) and generate the following metrics:

## Combat Metrics
- Heal/Shield Uptime (active duration รท game time)
- Stun Rate (successful stuns รท attempts)
- Aura Usage (time E-aura is active on allies)

## Positioning Metrics
- Distance to allies
- Distance to enemies
- Ward coverage

## Game State Features
- Gold difference
- Level difference
- Objective status
- Team composition

## Mechanical Actions
- Mouse click patterns (right-click vs left-click)
- Ability sequence timing
- Auto-attack reset timing
- Target selection patterns

The processed features are exported to [data/features/taric_features.csv](mdc:data/features/taric_features.csv) for model training.
